# OhmGeek.co.uk
My personal website, upgraded!

## Tools used:
  - React
  - Grommet UI
  - npm
  
## Working with the project:
### Running a development server
Simply run the command:

```bash
npm start
```
This will start the dev server which will autoupdate.

### Running the build
Build the entire site by running

```bash
npm run build
```

Anything in the build folder needs to be transferred via FTP to the web host.
