# OhmGeek.co.uk/API
This is an API directory. This is a REST API based in PHP that will eventually
allow advanced functionality on the site itself. For example, this will be how
we fetch website content (using the REST API), and possibly manage content via
OAuth.

## Ideas:
- Use the SLIM PHP framework to serve the API
- Basic CMS based on JSON blocks (either working with a database or otherwise)
- Otherwise, we could use something with Firebase to allow us to have a basic
  backend.
