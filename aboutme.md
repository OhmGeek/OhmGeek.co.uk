Hi, I'm Ryan! Some facts:
- I'm a Software Engineer (Java developer, and distributed systems engineer mostly)
- I enjoy (you might say super interested in) the Disney Parks (including the history/learning how things work behind the scenes)
- I'm a Star Trek fan (DS9 is my favourite, but all the Treks are good)
- I have allergies, and will share my experiences of having allergies to anyone who asks. 
- I do quite like puns. I'll see myself out.
